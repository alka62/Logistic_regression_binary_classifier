# Logistic Regression Binary Classifier

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **binary classification** model using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin** dataset.  
The goal is to predict whether a tumor is **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)** based on various medical features.

The notebook covers:
- Data loading & preprocessing
- Train/test split
- Feature standardization
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **ROC-AUC**
- Threshold tuning
- Sigmoid function explanation
